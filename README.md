Pot-de-Miel
===========

What this PHP script does is automatically generate thousands of random email addresses whenever it is accessed. So visiting the file in your browser, youâ€™ll see the same thing that a harvester will see: thousands of email addresses ripe for the plucking. Only these emails are bogus, leading the spammers on a wild goose chase that consumes their resources, drains their bandwidth, dilutes their potency, and ultimately costs them time and precious money. Punishment fits the crime is an understatement.

in robot.txt, add :
User-agent: *
Disallow: /emails.php
